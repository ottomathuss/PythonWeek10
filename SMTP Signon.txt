Add your email and password to your email server e.g.

john.doe@acme.com roadrunner

roadrunner is the password. 

There are a few changes you need to make in order to get it to work on your end:

Make sure to specify the proper SMTP server and port in line 28 of module mod_email.py.

Change the email address of Bob Smith to an email that you can access. See line 63 of the main program.

Change my email address in line 62 of mod_email.py to your own email address.

I think that's it. Good luck!
